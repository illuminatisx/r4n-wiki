## Overview

The Launch Site is one of the most high-tier monuments in Rust, offering exceptional loot but also significant danger. For new players, this monument can be intimidating but extremely rewarding. The monument features a large rocket, a main building complex, and several auxiliary structures. The area has high radiation levels, especially near the rocket, requiring proper protection. And do not forget the roaming Bradley APC.

## For New Players

If you're new to Rust, here's what you should know about the Launch Site:

- This is considered an **end-game monument** with the best loot but highest risk
- Expect to encounter experienced players here frequently
- Consider visiting during off-peak hours when the server has fewer players
- Use this monument to learn about high-tier gameplay, but don't get discouraged if you die frequently

## Requirements

To successfully loot the Launch Site, you will need:

- **Radiation protection**: A Hazmat suit or armor totalling up to 25 radiation protection is the minimum requirement. For areas like the red card room, you may need additional protection like anti-radiation pills
- **Red keycard**: Required for accessing the main building's elite crate room
- **Blue keycard**: Needed for the red card puzzle sequence
- **Green keycard**: Required to start the puzzle sequence
- **Fuses**: At least 2-3 fuses (they can break during use)
- **Weapons**: At minimum, a semi-automatic rifle or comparable weapon
- **Medical supplies**: At the very least 3-5 medical syringes and bandages
- **Food and water**: For extended looting sessions
- **Backpack**: If you plan on taking down the Bradley APC as well

## Radiation Zones

As a new player, understanding radiation is crucial at the Launch Site:

- **Low radiation**: Outer perimeter and warehouses
- **Medium radiation**: Main building and surrounding areas
- **High radiation**: Rocket area and certain interior sections like the red card room

Without protection, you'll take damage rapidly in medium and high radiation zones. Your radiation level appears as a red indicator on your HUD above your vital stats.

## Monument Layout

The Launch Site consists of several key areas:

1. **Main Building Complex**: Multi-story structure with the card puzzle and elite loot
2. **Rocket Area**: High radiation zone with good loot but dangerous exposure
3. **Warehouses**: Multiple storage buildings with moderate loot and minimal radiation
4. **Bradley Patrol Zone**: Central area where the Bradley APC patrols
5. **External Compounds**: Smaller buildings around the perimeter with basic loot

For new players, the warehouses are the safest starting point to learn the monument.

## Puzzle Solution (Detailed Steps)

For beginners, here's a step-by-step guide to completing the card puzzle:

1. **Find building 011**: Go to the green building labeled with '011' near the rocket and flip the switch inside
2. **To the stone building**: Run past the rocket and find the stone building with a metal ramp, go down the stairs and into the room on the left and flip the switch
3. **Scaffolding**: Run to the rocket scaffolding and drop down the hole
4. **Life or death**: Jump across the ledge, activate the timer and go through the doorway
5. **Life or death 2, electric boogaloo**: Now jump across the beams to the other side and press the red button
6. **Loot part 1**: Grab the loot inside and press the other button to get out
7. **To the silos**: Run to the building with the green door near the 3 silos, open the door with your green card, input a fuse and flip the switch
8. **More running**: Go to the far side of the monument to the building with the 2 blue containers across from the silos
9. **Going inside**: Go inside the building and you'll find another fuse box, add in your fuse and flip the switch
10. **Back to the jungle**: Now exit the building and run to the large central building and find the red door
11. **Into the belly of the beast**: Use your red card, enter the building, survive and loot everything you can!

The entire puzzle should be completed within 3-4 minutes before fuses expire.

## Loot Locations (Detailed)

For new players looking to maximize their loot runs:

### Main Building
- **Ground Floor**: Military crates in maintenance rooms (medium-tier loot)
- **Second Floor**: Scientist offices with regular crates (medium-tier loot)
- **Top Floor**: Elite crate room (high-tier loot, requires red keycard)
- **Roof Access**: Military crate sometimes spawns on the roof

### Rocket Area
- **Base of Rocket**: Multiple military crates (high radiation warning!)
- **Scaffolding**: Tool crates and occasional military crates

### Warehouses
- **Northern Warehouse**: 2-3 regular crates, good for components
- **Eastern Warehouses**: Multiple regular and occasional military crates
- **Southern Storage**: Good for barrels and basic resources

### Bradley APC Loot
- When destroyed, the Bradley drops 3-4 crates with high-tier weapons, armor and components
- **Warning**: Destroying Bradley requires launcher weapons and attracts significant attention
- **Warning**: When Bradley gets damaged, it will spawn multiple heavily armed guards

## Scientists and NPCs

The Launch Site is patrolled by hostile NPCs:

- **Regular Scientists**: Found throughout the monument, armed with pistols and rifles
- **Heavy Scientists**: Sometimes spawn near the elite crate room, heavily armored with better weapons
- **Bradley APC**: An armored vehicle that patrols the central area, equipped with a cannon and machine gun

For new players, scientists can be avoided by crouching and moving slowly around corners. Learn the patrol routes!

## Dangers and Threats

Beyond radiation, be aware of:

1. **Other Players**: The Launch Site is highly contested by experienced players
2. **Bradley APC**: Will fire upon players who get too close
3. **Fall Damage**: The main building has many high platforms and ledges
4. **Campers**: Players often hide near the elite crate room or building exits
5. **Counter Raiders**: When Bradley is destroyed, expect players to converge on the area

## Tips & Tricks for Beginners

- **Reconnaissance**: Observe the monument from a distance before approaching
- **Sound Discipline**: Use silenced weapons to avoid attracting attention
- **Quick Looting**: Have a planned route and don't linger too long
- **Escape Routes**: Plan multiple paths to leave the monument quickly
- **Time Management**: Dawn/dusk runs offer better visibility for you while making it harder for snipers
- **Bradley Timing**: The Bradley respawns approximately 1 hour after being destroyed
- **Partner System**: Bring a friend to watch your back while looting
- **Stash Strategy**: Consider hiding a stash with backup gear nearby in case you die

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Underestimating Radiation**: Always check your radiation protection before entering
- **Forgetting Fuses**: Nothing is more frustrating than getting to the puzzle and having no fuses
- **Tunnel Vision**: Don't focus so much on looting that you miss hearing approaching players
- **Overloading**: Know when to leave with your loot rather than getting greedy
- **Poor Planning**: Have all keycards and tools ready before starting the puzzle

Remember that mastering the Launch Site takes practice. Don't be discouraged by initial failures as each run teaches you valuable lessons about one of Rust's most rewarding monuments.
