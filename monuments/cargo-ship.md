## Overview

The Cargo Ship (CCSC Lazarus) is one of Rust's most unique monuments. Unlike other static monuments, this massive cargo vessel is mobile and only spawns periodically. The ship announces its arrival with a loud horn that can be heard across the map. When it appears, it circles the map for about 50 minutes before leaving the area.

## For New Players

If you're new to Rust, here's what you should know about the Cargo Ship:

- This is a **high-tier monument** with excellent loot but significant difficulty
- The ship is mobile and spawns every 2 - 3 hours
- Listen for the ship's horn to know when it spawns
- There is no radiation while the ship is circling the map
- Heavy radiation appears when the ship leaves
- Heavy scientist presence and high risk of enemy players makes solo runs extremely challenging
- Water transportation is required to reach the monument or wait for it to dock in a harbor
- This monument is best approached with a group until you're very experienced

## Requirements

To fully explore the Cargo Ship, you will need:

- **Weapons**: High-tier weapons (AK-47, LR-300, or better)
- **Medical supplies**: 5-10 medical syringes and enough bandages
- **Water transportation**: Boat, RHIB, or minicopter
- **Group members**: Highly recommended for new players
- **Backpack**: Since you will be able to loot a lot of items, a backpack isn't a luxury

## Crate Mechanics

The Cargo Ship's locked crates are a key feature:

- **Crate Locations**: 3 locked crates spawn on the ship
- **Hacking Process**:
  - Takes 15 minutes to complete
  - Progress is shown via a timer
  - Cannot be interrupted or the timer resets
- **Loot Tables**:
  - Military grade weapons
  - High-tier armor
  - Explosives and ammunition
  - Valuable components
  - Rare items

## Ship Timeline

Understanding the timing is crucial:

1. **Spawn**: Ship appears with loud horn signal
2. **Active Period**: ~50 minutes of sailing
3. **Crate spawn indication**: The ship will sound its horn 3 times when a locked crate spawns
4. **Warning**: Ship horn signals departure
5. **Departure Phase**:
   - Heavy radiation begins
   - Ship disappears from map

## Radiation Mechanics

The Cargo Ship has unique radiation mechanics:

- **While Ship is Active**: No radiation on the ship
- **After Ship Leaves**: 
  - Radiation quickly increases
  - Can be deadly if not prepared

## Detailed Monument Layout

Understanding the layout is crucial for survival:

### Bow Section
- **Helipad**: Alternative entry/exit point
- **Bridge**: Contains important loot and scientists
- **Crew Quarters**: Contains regular loot
- **Locked Crate Spawn**: Common crate location

### Cargo Holds
- **Main Cargo Area**: Contains basic loot and resources
- **Storage Areas**: Various loot and components
- **Locked Crate Spawn**: Common crate location
- **Container Areas**: Good cover during fights

### Stern Section
- **Engine Room**: Contains important loot
- **Locked Crate Spawn**: Common crate location
- **Crane Control**: Good vantage point for sniping
- **Lower Deck**: Additional loot spawns

## Scientist Locations

Scientists in Cargo Ship are numerous and well-armed:

- **Top of the bridge**: 2 scientists
- **Bridge control**: 1 scientist
- **Side room on the way to the bridge**: 1 scientist
- **Upper deck infront of the bridge**: 1 scientist
- **Lower deck infront of the bridge**: 1 scientist
- **Middle of upper deck, near containers**: 2 scientists
- **Near / On crows nest**: 1 scientist
- **Passageways on lower deck**: 2 scientists
- **Blow deck**: 2 scientists

Making for a total of **13** scientists. Keep in mind that the main threat of this monument comes from other players or: "Counters" rather than the PVE element.

## Loot Locations (Detailed)

For new players looking to maximize their loot runs:

### Regular Loot
- **Military Crates**: Weapons, ammo, components
- **Elite Crates**: High-tier weapons, armor, rare items
- **Regular Crates**: Basic resources and components
- **Scientist Drops**: Weapons, ammo, medical supplies

### Locked Crates
- **Military Grade Weapons**: AK-47, LR-300, L96 etc.
- **Explosives**: C4, Rockets, Satchels etd.
- **Rare Items**: High quality metal, Tech trash etc.
- **Components**: Advanced components and resources

## Common Threats and Dangers

Beyond scientists, be aware of:

1. **Other Players**: Cargo Ship is highly contested
2. **Counter Raiders**: Players often wait for others to complete hacks
3. **Limited Cover**: Many open areas on deck
4. **Hack Timer**: 15-minute vulnerability period

## Looting Strategies for Beginners

### Solo Strategy (Not Recommended)
1. **Quick Loot Runs**: Focus on regular crates
2. **Night Operations**: Less player competition
3. **Countering**: Wait for others to complete hacks

### Group Strategy (Recommended)
1. **Cover Formation**: Players covering different angles
2. **Scientist Control**: Clear and control scientist spawns, leaving a few as "alarms"
3. **Multiple Hacks**: Run multiple crates simultaneously

## Tips & Tricks for New Players

- **Sound Awareness**: Listen for footsteps and gunfire
- **Map Learning**: Study the layout from safe positions
- **Scientist Patterns**: Learn spawn points and patrol routes
- **Weapon Choice**: High-tier weapons are essential
- **Hack Timing**: Start hacks early in ship's cycle
- **Emergency Exit**: Know multiple escape routes
- **Counter Defense**: Watch for counter raiders
- **Ship Timing**: Track the 50 minute cycle

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Poor Timing**: Don't start hacks too late in cycle
- **Poor Weapon Choice**: Bring the best weapons available
- **Inadequate Supplies**: Bring extra ammo and medical supplies
- **Getting Lost**: Pay attention to landmarks
- **Solo Attempts**: Avoid solo runs until very experienced
- **Poor Transportation**: Always have a backup escape plan
- **Hack Interruption**: Don't let hack timer reset

## Alternative Entry Methods

Besides the main entrance, consider:

1. **Helipad Landing**: Quick but exposed
2. **Side Climbing**: Using terrain elevation
3. **RHIB Approach**: Fast and maneuverable
4. **Multiple Entry Points**: Split team entry

The Cargo Ship represents one of Rust's most unique and challenging monuments. While extremely dangerous, mastering it will make you a much more capable player. Start with group runs and gradually work up to more advanced strategies as you gain experience.
