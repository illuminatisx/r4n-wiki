## Overview

The Cargo Ship (CCSC Lazarus) is one of Rust's most unique monuments. Unlike static monuments, this massive cargo vessel is mobile and spawns every 2–3 hours. It circles the map for about 50 minutes before departing, with a loud horn signaling both its arrival and key events.

## For New Players

Important things to know:

- **High-risk, high-reward**: Excellent loot, but difficult to secure
- **Mobile**: Circles the map for ~50 minutes, then departs
- **No radiation** during its active period, but **lethal radiation** starts when it leaves
- **Requires water or air transport**: Boat, RHIB, paddle board, or aircraft
- **Best with a team**: Soloing is risky due to heavy scientists and PvP threats

## Requirements

Essentials for a successful Cargo Ship run:

- **Weapons**: Medium to high-tier (e.g., Semi-auto rifle, Thompson)
- **Medical Supplies**: 5–10 syringes, bandages
- **Transport**: Boat, RHIB, aircraft, or paddle board
- **Backpack**: Helps carry large amounts of loot
- **Team (Recommended)**: New players should not go solo

## Ship Timeline

Understanding the phases:

1. **Spawn**: Loud horn across the map signals arrival
2. **Active Phase** (~50 minutes):
   - Crates spawn throughout
   - Triple horn blast signals each locked crate activation
3. **Departure Warning**:
   - Sirens and lights activate
4. **Radiation Phase**:
   - Ship moves outside the map edge
   - Heavy radiation begins

## Crate Mechanics

There are 4 locked crates that spawn on the ship:

- **Spawn Timing**:
  - Crates appear during the ship's sail, one can spawn when docked at a harbor
  - Each takes **15 minutes** to hack
- **Crate Loot**:
  - Military-grade weapons (AK, LR-300, L96)
  - High-tier armor
  - Explosives (C4, rockets, satchels)
  - Rare resources (tech trash, HQM)
  - Advanced components

## Radiation Mechanics

Radiation behavior differs from other monuments:

- **While Active**: No radiation onboard
- **After Departure**:
  - Radiation spikes rapidly
  - Will kill even fully geared players

## Monument Layout

### Stern (Back)
- **Bridge**: Key loot area; heavy scientist presence
- **RHIB Spawn**: Includes 50 low grade fuel; good escape
- **Locked Crate Location**

### Cargo Hold (Midship)
- **Scientists**: 2 guarding this section
- **Loot**: Regular and elite crates, components
- **Cover**: Containers provide hiding spots
- **Locked Crate Location**

### Bow (Front)
- **Crow's Nest**: Good for scouting; guarded by 1 scientist
- **Landing Zone**: Suitable for helicopters
- **Locked Crate Location**

## Scientist Positions

Total of **13 scientists** onboard:

- 2 on top of the bridge
- 1 in bridge control
- 1 in side room to bridge
- 1 on upper deck in front of bridge
- 1 on lower deck in front of bridge
- 2 near mid containers (upper deck)
- 1 in crow’s nest
- 2 in lower deck passageways
- 2 below deck

> PvP is the bigger threat — counters are more dangerous than scientists.

## Loot Guide

### Regular Loot
- **Military Crates**: Medium-tier gear, components
- **Elite Crates**: High-tier weapons and armor
- **Regular Crates**: Basic resources
- **Scientist Drops**: Ammo, meds, occasional weapons

### Locked Crates
- Best loot available:
  - High-end weapons (AK, L96, MP5, M92)
  - Explosives (C4, rockets, satchels)
  - Rare components (tech trash, HQM, targeting computers)

## Threats & Dangers

Watch out for:

1. **Enemy Players**: Most common and dangerous threat
2. **Grubs**: Hide until you finish crate hacks
3. **Open Decks**: Limited cover on upper decks
4. **Hack Vulnerability**: 15-minute crate timer draws counters

## Strategies for Beginners

### Solo Strategy *(Not Recommended)*
- Focus on **quick looting** of unlocked crates
- Operate at **night** for lower visibility
- Let others hack crates, then **counter**

### Group Strategy *(Recommended)*
- **Divide coverage**: Assign roles for angles, decks
- **Control AI**: Clear or leave scientists as alarms
- **Multi-hack**: Run multiple crate hacks at once for efficiency

## Tips & Tricks

- **Listen**: Footsteps, gunfire, crate timers, horn blasts
- **Memorize Layout**: Use containers and corridors to your advantage
- **Pre-plan Escape**: Have at least one escape strategy
- **Use High Ground**: Bridge and crow’s nest give control
- **Hack Early**: Start crate hacks early in the ship cycle
- **Don't Overloot**: Prioritize value over volume

## Common Mistakes

Avoid these pitfalls:

- **Late Hacks**: Don't trigger crate hacks near end of ship’s cycle
- **Bad Gear Choices**: Bring solid weapons; avoid primitive gear
- **Insufficient Supplies**: Always bring enough meds and ammo
- **Going Solo Unprepared**: Team up until you're experienced

The Cargo Ship can be tough, but worth it if not for the loot - the experience. Good luck!
