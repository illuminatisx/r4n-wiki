To open the nuclear missile silo hatch and access the underground area, you must swipe their blue keycard here and press the red button afterward.

**Blue (Exit-Only) Blast Door**
This area is built into the rockface and resides outside the main compound area of the Nuclear Missile Silo monument. This door is inaccessible, except when opened from the inside,
Be aware othr players like to camp this door as its the only exit from the monument.

**Nuclear Missile Hatch (Entrance only)**
Once the blue keycard bit has been activated and the door begins opening, players may jump down to the first platform area (potentially hostile)
This is a one-way entrance; you cannot leave this way once you enter. (DO NOT touch the bottom of the large blast hatch doorway it will kill you).

## Monument Layout: Underground

### Underground Level 0:

**Initial Entry**
Making sure you jump down onto steel mesh stabilization platforms (without falling all the way down), you begin your adventure below.
When making this jump down, you will likely alert guards below who will start shooting at you.

> ⚠️ Warning: DO NOT touch the bottom of the large blast hatch doorway - it will kill you.

If this is the case, ignore the NPCs, jump down one more level onto the lit platform and you should be staring down the first Conical Passage.
This will be guarded by our first face-to-face Night Vision Scientists. Kill the scientist and continue through the dimly lit corridor to our first open room (Office 1).

**Office 1**
Office 1 of Level 0 is guarded by the single Night Vision scientist mentioned earlier and should contain 1 crate (brown or millatery).
There are no other points of interest in this room, so head back out into the corridor and descending a flight of stairs to Level 1 where another night Vision scientist will be lurking.

**Underground Level 1:**
At the bottom platform of the stairs, you should find a loot crate, a hard right turn and another 1-2 Night Vision scientists. 
After killing all immediately present scientist, continue on.

**Restroom 1**
A single loot crate will spawn in this room but there's a secret in here.
If you are struggling with health or do not want to waste meds, sit on the toilet and you get comfort to heal you back up to full health (providing you have food level over 100).

**Lobby 1**
After taking a pitstop on the toilet make your way down make ya way down to our first Elevator Lobby.
There should be one loot crate in your immediate path along with a few more night Vision scientist to kill.

There are several rooms off of this area wich are:

**Storage Room 1**
It is a simple storage area with possibility of up to 2 crates.

**Restricted Area 1**
A decoratively high-tech area possessing a single loot crate.

**Elevator to Level 2**
This is the sole way forward, so be sure to loot the other two rooms before moving on.
Look down and left of the elevator to the glowing control panel, and press the E key on Call Elevator to open the doors.
Enter and perform the same basic function to navigate down to floor 2.
This elevator may be used to come up and down between floors at any time.


### Underground Level 2:
When reaching the bottom of the elevator, it is extremely important to note that you will probably begin taking immediate fire from a 2+ night Vision scientist.

**Lobby 2-A**
This lobby area contains 2 loot crates before turning left into the next passage leading on.

**Passage 1**
Make your way through this passageway and note that scientists might begin to shoot at you from below again when you reach the mesh support platform. 
It is best to ignore them at this juncture and carry on the adventure.

**Center Missile Jumps**
There are 2 small jumps required to proceed, with a single loot box on the platform between them.
You might get shot from the scietist in the following corridor so make haste doing the jumps.

**Conical Passage 2**
Here you will find up to 3 night Vision scientist on the pathway in front of you. 
After killing them Head through this passage and you come to another small lobby.

**Elevator Floor 2 to 5**
As you come out of conical passage 2 and into the small Level 2 (labeled wall) lobby, you have the option of boarding an elevator in a small room to your right.
For now best to ignore the elevator and carry on into the next lobby.

**Passthrough Lobby**
In this part the level of difficulty rises. 
This room contains 8-10 scientist and they will come at you very quickly, which is one of the more stresful stages of the monument.
Rembering to fall back and med up is important.
As you pass through this next lobby area, two lootable crates are directly on your right, just before you enter the next room.

**Employees-Only Admin Office**
Here you will find 3+ more scientist hanging out.
Taking your time killing them then make your way through to the next room.

**Lobby 2-B**
Here you will find more scientist hanging out.
Off this room there are 2 side rooms with 1 lootable crate in each room (restroom and pantry)

**Elevator Floor 2 to 1 (Continued – Quick Exit)**
Here you have a choice.
If you are running out of meds or have no sapce to hold any more you can use the elevator to make your way to the exit.
However if you do decied to leave you will be missing out on the main loot.
If you want to carry on and you are up for the task ignore the elvator and carry on.

### Underground Level 3
Once you have finished looting the other rooms and killed all the scientist make your way down to the next set of stairs.
Similarly to floor 0-1, another crate spawn will be at the buttom, followed by a sharp turn brings us to the next lobby.

**Living Quarters Lobby**
This lobby will be protected by 2-3 scientist that partrol this level.
Note: some of them may be hiding in the rooms of the lobby.

**Living Quarters 1**
Room 1 known as Pookie Bear room is loacted of living quaters lobby and has a single crate spawn point.
Good area to take cover from scientists.

**Living Quarters 2**
Similar to the last room also located off the lobby however this room containes 2 lootable crates.

### Underground Level 4
Making your way back into the lobby after looting the side rooms, dencend further into the monument.
If you didnt see the scietist in the last lobby they will be lurking here.

**Computer Room**
This room is the only one on this level.
It holds 1 single loot crate.

### Underground Level 5
Once you have finished make your way down to the lowest level in the monument.
Here players will be greeted by a flashing red light, indicating danger ahead.
There should be roughly 3 scientists remaining on this level.

**Conical Passage 1**
At least one of those scientists should greet you immediately as you approach the red light and this conical passage.

**Large Garage Bay with Truck (AKA MAIN ROOM)**
Here you find the remaining 2 scientist typically lurking between the truck area ahead.
Getting too close to the warhead deployed can result in radiation tick accumulation VERY fast.

**Cavern**
The 'end-loot' area
Besides the wonderful guards... you already met, this area is home to 3 diesel barrels and an elite crate in the back of the truck.
AGAIN, getting too close to the warhead deployed can result in radiation tick accumulation VERY fast.
Also loacted in this room in a computer that actively ticks down (depending on the designated server wipe cycle) to the end-event, AKA wipe. 
A Red Keycard is sitting beside the laptop for your convenience, looting up and moving on.

**Elevator Floor 5 to 2**
Rember that elevator we ignored ealier, make your way back to it. 
Take the elevator up.

### Underground Level 1 (Continued)
You will be on floor 2 at the first elevator we circumnavigated. 
This time, we will exit the elevator and again take a right.
The pathways should still be free from scientists.
Continue until going back until you reach Elevator Floor 2 to 1 (Continued – Quick Exit).
From here on, we're back into new content.
Take the elevator up.

**Lobby 1 Cont. (Fire)**
Once the elevator door opens, you will immediately be welcomed by 3 Scientists and a roaring corner fire (no comfort, sorry).
Deal with your attackers and move on.
note: there is a side room here to check out but no loot will spawn in it (Control Room). Just for looks

### Underground Level 0 (Continued)
Continue up the stairs towards the exit and fianlly level part.

**Security Checkpoint (the end)**
Finally, located within this security checkpoint room, players will find a computer terminal with pre-programmed CCTV camera codes input so that you can view different portions of the monument. 
This is helful to see if anyone is camping your only exit.

**Quick Exit Blast Doors**
To open this door there be a big red button in the security checpoint room to the right of the door.
Note: if there 2 of you best shot is to send the person out first with the least important loot to check to see if its safe
If not safe the person that remaind inside can let you back in if you're quick enough

Congratulations you made it successfully. Head back home with all your riches!!!

## Few Notes & Tips
- People can enter the monument when you are running it if they also have a blue card, so keep your eyes on swivel.
