## Overview

The Military Tunnels is a medium-sized underground monument that offers excellent loot opportunities for new and experienced players alike. This network of tunnels carved into a mountain houses military-grade loot guarded by armed scientists. For new players, it presents a good balance of risk and reward compared to larger monuments.

## For New Players

If you're new to Rust, here's what you should know about the Military Tunnels:

- This is a **mid-tier monument** with good loot and moderate difficulty
- The underground layout can be confusing until you learn the paths
- Scientist NPCs pose a significant threat but are predictable
- This monument is excellent for learning PvE combat before facing real players

## Scientist Locations

Scientists in Military Tunnels follow patrol patterns:

- **Entrance Guards**: 2-3 scientists near the main entrance

- **Static Guards**: Scientists standing guard at key locations like the blue card room
- **Elite Room Guards**: 2-3 scientists guarding the final loot room

## Puzzle Solution (Detailed Steps)

For beginners, here's a comprehensive guide to completing the card puzzle:

1. **The beginning**: Take the right door at the front entrace and take a right
2. **The armory**: Find a door marked with a sign "Armory" to the right of it
3. **Entering the armory**: Now go down the hall and head into the first door on the right, find the fuse box and start the timer
4. **Heading back**: Head back out the way you came and down the tunnel as it curves right and look for a hole in the fence on the left
5. **Through the hole**: Now go through the hole in the fence and take a left and look for a door marked "storage" and open it.
6. **Flippin nice**: Head in and head to the right, you should see a switch labeled "Laboratory" you need to flip it
7. **Heading back out again**: Now head back out and go left towards the center of the core and loot the elite crates in the rail car
8. **Moving on**: Now exit the rail car and head towards your right and keep going until you see a blue door marked "Laboratory"
9. **Blue and red**: Open the blue door and then the red door that has a short timer attached to it
10. **Loot acquired**: Loot the main loot room and look for the quick exit on your left.

The entire puzzle must be completed within about 2-3 minutes before fuses expire.

## Loot Locations (Detailed)

### Administration Area
- **Offices**: Regular crates containing components and occasional weapons
- **Green Card Room**: Military crate and tool boxes

### Barracks Area
- **Sleeping Quarters**: Regular crates with clothing and basic components
- **Armory Lockers**: Military crates with weapons and ammunition

### Research Labs
- **Lab Rooms**: Regular crates with components and medical supplies
- **Secure Storage**: Military crates behind the blue card door

### Elite Loot Room
- **Final Room**: 2-3 elite crates, military crates, and sometimes an airdrop crate
- **Side Storage**: Additional military crates in adjacent rooms

## Common Threats and Dangers

Beyond scientists, be aware of:

1. **Other Players**: Military Tunnels is popular for its loot-to-danger ratio
2. **Disorientation**: The tunnel layout can be confusing for new players
3. **Ambushes**: The many corners and dark areas are perfect for player ambushes
4. **Limited Exits**: Knowing escape routes is crucial when confronted
5. **Time Pressure**: The puzzle requires quick movement once started

## Looting Strategies for Beginners

### Solo Strategy
1. **Stealth Approach**: Move slowly, take out scientists one by one with silenced weapons
2. **Quick In-and-Out**: Focus only on the puzzle and elite room, ignore other loot
3. **Perimeter Looting**: Just loot the surface and entrance areas for safer returns

### Group Strategy (2-3 Players)
1. **Cover Formation**: One player watches while others loot or handle the puzzle
2. **Divide and Conquer**: Split up to handle different sections simultaneously
3. **Relay System**: Pass keycards and fuses to the player moving toward the elite room

## Tips & Tricks for New Players

- **Sound Awareness**: Listen carefully - footsteps echo in the tunnels
- **Map Learning**: Draw or memorize the layout after each visit
- **Scientist Patterns**: Learn where scientists spawn and their patrol routes
- **Weapon Choice**: Silenced weapons are crucial to avoid attracting attention
- **Light Discipline**: Turn your flashlight off when not needed to avoid detection
- **Recycler Usage**: The recycler inside is relatively safe compared to other monuments
- **Stashing Loot**: Consider temporarily stashing valuable loot outside before making the final exit

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Underestimating Scientists**: They can be deadly in groups, especially in confined spaces
- **Running Out of Ammo**: Bring more than you think you'll need
- **Forgetting Fuses**: Always bring multiple fuses in case one breaks
- **Getting Lost**: Pay attention to landmarks and signs within the tunnels
- **Lingering Too Long**: The longer you stay, the more likely other players will arrive

Military Tunnels is an excellent "stepping stone" monument for new players looking to progress beyond basic monuments but not yet ready for high-risk areas like Launch Site. Master it, and you'll develop skills applicable to all of Rust's more challenging locations.
