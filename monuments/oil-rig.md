- **Blue keycard**: Required to gain entry to the red card door
- **Green keycard**: Required for some additional loot
- **Protection**: A good set of armor as you will be fighting a lot of scientists
- **Weapons**: High-tier weapons (AK-47, LR-300, or better)
- **Medical supplies**: 5-10 medical syringes minimum and enough bandages
- **Water or air transportation**: Boat or helicopter
- **Group members**: Highly recommended for new players

## Detailed Monument Layout

Understanding the layout is crucial for survival:

### Middle Levels
- **Green Card Room**: Nice additional loot

### Upper Levels
- **Control Room**: Contains important loot
- **Helipad**: Alternative entry/exit point
- **Blue Card Room**: Entry to the red card room
- **Red Card Room**: Contains the hackable crate

### Special Areas
- **Crane Control**: Good vantage point for sniping

## Scientist Locations

Scientists in Oil Rig are numerous and well-armed: Up to **16** scientists are protecting the monument against raiders! After you trigger the crate hacking an additional 6 heavy scientists will be called in to fight you.

## Loot Locations (Detailed)

## Common Threats and Dangers

Beyond scientists, be aware of:

1. **Other Players**: Oil Rig is highly contested
2. **Water Transportation**: Risk of losing boats or helicopters
3. **Vertical Layout**: Easy to get trapped or ambushed
4. **Limited Exits**: Few escape routes available
5. **Scientist Aggression**: High density of scientists on a smaller surface, increases the risk of being overrun

## Looting Strategies for Beginners

### Solo Strategy (Not Recommended)
1. **Quick Loot Runs**: Focus on lower levels only
2. **Night Operations**: Less player competition at night
3. **Perimeter Looting**: Stay on the outer edges

### Group Strategy (Recommended)

2. **Divide Roles**: Assign players to different tasks
3. **Staged Approach**: Clear areas, open puzzles rooms and finish off with the hackable crate

## Tips & Tricks for New Players

- **Map Learning**: Study the layout from safe positions
- **Scientist Patterns**: Learn spawn points and patrol routes
- **Weapon Choice**: High-tier weapons are essential
- **Emergency Exit**: Know multiple escape routes
- **Keep scanning**: Always keep an eye on the water and the air for incoming counters

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Insufficient Protection**: Don't skimp on protection
- **Poor Weapon Choice**: Bring the best weapons available
- **Inadequate Supplies**: Bring extra ammo and medical supplies
- **Getting Lost**: Pay attention to landmarks
- **Poor Timing**: Don't start oil after the hackable crate has been cleared
- **Solo Attempts**: Avoid solo runs until very experienced

## Alternative Entry Methods

Besides the main entrance, consider:

1. **Helipad Access**: Can provide high ground advantage
2. **Water Access**: Multiple points around the platform

The Oil Rig represents one of Rust's most unique and challenging monuments. While extremely dangerous, mastering it will make you a much more capable player. Start with group runs and gradually work up to more advanced strategies as you gain experience.
