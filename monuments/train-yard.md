- **Hopper/skip**: At the bottom of the ladder, to the right of the entrance, there is a yellow skip, you can use this to retrieve the contents of your train car.

## Noteworthy

## Unloader
This feature can be useful when you need large quantities of low grade fuel, or ore materials. This is the only location on the map you are able to unload train cars, this can mean increased traffic to this monument. If the map has no train tracks generated, this will not be an issue.

### Locked crate
Train yard is a common drop location for the locked crate, it will drop in the center of the monument, next to the car park. There are a variety of good locations to watch over from, including the top of the main building, or the water tower.
