## Overview

The first half hour in Rust is the most vulnerable and crucial period of your entire wipe. As a new player, your decisions during these initial minutes will determine whether you establish yourself or face repeated deaths. This expanded guide will walk you through every step of your early journey.

## Understanding the basics

- You spawn on a random beach location with only a rock and torch
- Each server has different spawn areas, typically along the coastline
- Pressing the "respawn" button will generate a random spawn
- Pressing on one of your bags / beds will force you to spawn in them
- Day/night cycles last about 60 minutes total, with 45 minutes of daylight and 15 minutes of darkness
- Weather conditions can affect visibility and survival (e.g. rain causes wetness which lowers temperature)

## Immediate Priorities (First 2 Minutes)

The moment you spawn:

1. **Stay calm and assess**: Press G to open your map and note your location
2. **Find cover**: Move away from the beach into trees or behind rocks
3. **Check surroundings**: Look for aggressive players, monuments, or animals
4. **Find hemp plants**: Find hemp plants for cloth in forested area's and craft a bag or two

## Understanding Hunger and Thirst (Minutes 2-5)

The bottom right of your screen shows vital stats:

- **Health**: Plus sign (100 maximum)
- **Hunger**: Cutlery sign (500 maximum)
- **Thirst**: Glass of water sign (250 maximum)
- **Temperature**: Thermometer sign

When starting:
- Food is your priority over water (hunger depletes faster)
- Picking food (pumpkins, corn, berries) is safer than hunting
- Drinking from rivers/lakes is possible, drinking from the ocean isn't.
- Actions consume stats, mining a rock or chopping down a tree will affect your hunger and thirst stats

## Initial Gathering (Minutes 5-10)

During your first few minutes:

1. **Wood gathering**:
   - Hit trees with your rock (aim for the "X" that appears for faster gathering)
   - Each tree gives approximately 376 wood when hit with a rock
   - Gather at least 2,000 - 2,500 wood minimum

2. **Stone gathering**:
   - Hit rocks (grey nodes)
   - Aim for the "sparkle" that appears for faster gathering
   - Gather at least 1,000 - 1,500 stone

3. **Cloth gathering**:
   - Pick hemp plants (green plants)
   - Each plant gives ~10 cloth
   - Gather minimum 30 cloth for a sleeping bag

4. **Food gathering**:
   - Pick mushrooms around trees
   - Look for pumpkins/corn near rivers
   - Hunt animals only if you have a weapon (bow/spear or better)

## Crafting Your First Tools (Minutes 10-15)

Essential first tools in order of priority:

1. **Stone Hatchet** (200 wood, 100 stone)
   - Access: Press Tab > Crafting > Tools > Stone Hatchet
   - Purpose: faster wood gathering than rock

2. **Stone Pickaxe** (200 wood, 100 stone)
   - Access: Press Tab > Crafting > Tools > Stone Pickaxe
   - Purpose: faster stone/metal/sulfur gathering than rock

3. **Wooden Spear** (300 wood)
   - Access: Press Tab > Crafting > Weapons > Wooden Spear
   - Purpose: Basic defense against players and animals

4. **Bow and Arrows** (200 wood, 50 cloth for bow, 25 wood + 10 stone per arrow)
   - Access: Press Tab > Crafting > Weapons > Hunting Bow
   - Purpose: Ranged combat and hunting

## Finding a Base Location (Minutes 15-20)

When choosing your first base location:

### Good Locations (for beginners):
- **Near forest and nodes**: For easy resource gathering
- **Near small monuments**: Like Supermarket or Gas Station (not Launch Site or Military Tunnels)
- **Away from large bases**: Avoid established clan territories
- **Off main roads**: To reduce traffic near your base
- **Near freshwater**: Rivers/lakes for hydration
- **Forests**: Hiding between trees

### Poor Locations (avoid as a beginner):
- **On beaches**: Too visible and high traffic
- **Near Tier 2/3 monuments**: High player activity and geared players
- **In open fields**: No natural cover or resources
- **Snowy areas**: Temperature management is difficult
- **Desert areas**: Limited resources and high visibility

## Building Your First Base (Minutes 20-30)

### Starter Base Essentials:

1. **Craft Building Plan and Hammer**:
   - Building Plan (20 wood)
   - Hammer (100 wood)

2. **Key Base Components**:
   - **Tool Cupboard (TC)**: 1,000 wood (prevents others from building nearby)
   - **Door**: 300 wood
   - **Key Lock**: 75 wood (secure and doesn't require key if solo)
   - **Sleeping Bag**: 30 cloth (your respawn point)
   - **Small Stash**: 10 cloth (hidden storage if burried)
   - **Small Box**: 100 wood (basic storage)
   - **Campfire**: 100 wood (cooking and warmth)

3. **Simple 2x1 Layout**:
   - Place a foundation
   - Place a wall on the back of the foundation
   - Place a wall on the right side of the foundation
   - Place TC in corner where the walls overlap (authorize by pressing E)
   - Lock the TC with a Key Lock
   - Attach another foundation
   - On the side place a triangle foundation
   - Place 2 doorframes on the triangle foundation leading in
   - Place the rest of the walls and roofs
   - Place 2 doors in the doorframe, the outermost opening inwards and the other outwards
   - Place sleeping bag away from door
   - Place boxes in a corner next to TC
   - Upgrade walls, foundations, roof and doorframes to stone as soon as possible

### Building Instructions:
1. Equip building plan
2. Right-click to select building piece (start with foundation)
3. Left-click to place
4. Use hammer to upgrade (wood â†’ stone is crucial)
5. Place TC and authorize immediately
6. Build walls, doorway, door, and ceiling
7. Add key lock to door
8. Place sleeping bag (this is your respawn point!)

## Immediate Next Steps

After establishing a starter base:

1. **Craft a Furnace** (50 low grade fuel, 200 stone, 100 wood)
2. **Create a workbench** (500 wood, 100 metal fragments, 50 scrap)
3. **Collect scrap from barrels and crates**
4. **Research essential items** (clothing, weapons etc.)
5. **Upgrade tools** (from stone to metal)

## Vital Combat Tips for Beginners

When encountering other players during your first 30 minutes:

1. **Avoidance is key**: If you see a player, crouch (press Ctrl) and hide
2. **Use terrain**: Stay near trees and rocks for quick cover
3. **Listen carefully**: Footsteps give away player positions
4. **Run zigzag**: If being shot at, never run in a straight line
5. **Don't get discouraged**: Death is common in Rust, even for experienced players

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Building too big**: A small, finished base is better than a large, incomplete one
2. **Keeping everything in one box**: Spread loot in case of raids
3. **Trusting strangers**: Most players will kill you for your rock
4. **Making too much noise**: Hitting barrels/trees or firing weapons attracts attention
5. **Forgetting to lock doors**: Always verify your door is locked
6. **Building in high-traffic areas**: Visibility equals vulnerability

## Communication Basics

- **Voice chat**: Press V to talk (use sparingly and quietly)
- **Text chat**: Press T to type in chat
- **Hand gestures**: Press and hold B for gestures (waving can sometimes prevent being killed)

## Advanced Tips for Quick Starts

1. **Compound Bow Strategy**: Craft a compound bow early for ambushing better-equipped players
2. **Night Farming**: Use darkness to gather resources more safely
3. **Barrel Roads**: Follow roads for fast component gathering
4. **Beginner Eco Raid**: Use spears to break wooden doors or softside walls if desperate

## Server Selection for New Players

If you haven't chosen a server yet:

- **Low population**: Servers with 25-50 players are ideal for learning
- **Monthly wipe**: Gives you time to establish yourself and have a life outside of Rust as well
- **Smaller map size**: Increases encounter frequency but reduces running time
- **Solo/Duo/Trio**: Limits group sizes, better for new players
- **PvE or Beginner-friendly**: Some servers have specific rules in place to make it beginner-friendly. Rust4Noobs for example!

Remember, your first 30 minutes determine the trajectory of your entire wipe. Stay calm, focus on fundamentals, and don't get discouraged by initial deaths. Rust has a steep learning curve, but the satisfaction of establishing yourself makes it worthwhile!
