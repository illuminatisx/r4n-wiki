## Overview

Rust is a brutal survival game where players must navigate a hostile world filled with other players, wildlife, and environmental challenges. This guide will help you understand the fundamental concepts of Rust before you even enter the game.

## Game Cycles and Wipes

Rust servers operate on a "wipe" cycle:

- **Wipe**: A complete reset of the server, clearing all player progress
- **Map Wipe**: Resets the map, buildings, and resources (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly or some other setup)
- **BP Wipe**: Resets all learned blueprints, forcing you to fully start from 0
- **Force Wipe**: Official wipes enforced by [FacePunch](https://rust.facepunch.com/) that happen on the first Thursday of every month

Understanding the wipe schedule of your chosen server is crucial as it determines how long your progress will last.

## Choosing a Server

As a new player, server selection greatly impacts your experience:

- **Official Servers**: High population, no admins, regular cheaters
- **Community Servers**: Player-run with active admins, various wipe schedules and a (near) vanilla experience
- **Modded Servers**: Modified gameplay (gather rates, maps, plugins)
- **Solo/Duo/Trio etc**: Limit group sizes, better for beginners
- **PvE Servers**: Focus on survival against environment, no player threat
- **Beginner-friendly**: Some servers are specifically designed for new players, like Rust4Noobs!

**Recommendation**: Start on a low-population community server with "noob friendly" or "beginner" in the title, ideally with a solo/duo/trio restriction. Checkout one of Rust4Noob's servers for example.

## Core Game Mechanics

### Resources and Gathering

The five primary resources are:

- **Wood**: Gathered from trees, essential for building
- **Stone**: Mined from rock formations, used for stronger buildings
- **Metal Ore**: Collected from specific rocks, refined into Metal Fragments
- **High quality metal ore**: Collected in small amounts from metal ore nodes
- **Sulfur Ore**: Gathered from yellow-tinted rocks, used for ammunition and explosives

When gathering:
1. Hit the bright red X that appears while hitting trees or the shimmer effect while hitting nodes
2. Use the appropriate tool for each resource (stone pickaxe for nodes, etc.)

### Blueprints and Workbenches

The progression system in Rust is based on:

- **Blueprints (BPs)**: Recipes to craft items, learned by researching
- **Scrap**: Currency used for research, vending machines and in safe zones
- **Workbenches**: Required for crafting higher-tier items
  - Tier 1: Basic weapons and tools
  - Tier 2: Mid-tier weapons and advanced components
  - Tier 3: Advanced weapons and raiding tools

### Health and Survival Mechanics

Monitor these stats to stay alive:

- **Health**: Decreases from damage, drowning, falling and bleeding
- **Hunger**: Decreases over time or with actions, eat food to replenish
- **Thirst**: Decreases over time or with actions, drink water or certain foods to replenish
- **Temperature**: Affected by clothing, weather, and time of day
- **Radiation**: Found in monuments, requires protective clothing

## Essential Controls and Actions

- **Tab**: Opens inventory
- **Q**: Opens crafting menu
- **E**: Use/interact with objects
- **R**: Reload weapon
- **T**: Chat
- **V**: Voice chat
- **G**: Open map

## First Steps After Learning Basics

Once you understand these core concepts:

1. Check out the "Your First 30 Minutes in Rust" guide
2. Learn about base building fundamentals
3. Practice combat on aim train servers
4. Explore monuments starting with the safer ones

Remember that dying is part of Rust. Everyone loses everything eventually, so focus on learning rather than getting frustrated by losses.
