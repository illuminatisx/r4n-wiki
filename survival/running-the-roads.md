## I've built my base, now what?
After securing your first base and finding enough resources to survive, you now need to run the roads for scrap (Rust currency), fuel, and components.
These are three things that will enable you to progress through the game and get an advantage on other players through crafting and learning blueprints.
The roads are a place where you will find many players early on in the game so be sure to keep a look out, and take a tool, spear, or a bow and arrow to defend yourself.

## What you should expect:
On the roads, you will find various junkyard style cars, vans, flatbed trucks, tool and food boxes, and barrels of different colours.
The brown wooden crates, blue plastic tubs, food boxes, and tool boxes can be opened by pressing "E", but you will need to hit the barrels to get loot from them. 
In the yellow and blue barrels you will find various components, clothing items, tools, and if you're very lucky you may even find a gun or high value loot.
The red barrels contain fuel, and you will be able to pick up both crude oil, and low grade fuel.

## The dangers of the roads:
The roads are often an open area and not only put you at risk of dying to players and having your loot stolen, but scientists also. 
Scientists wear blue hazmat suits, and carry a gun which they will use if you get too close to them. You can sometimes hear their radio as you approach, but there are often jumpscares at night time. 
If you have a bow and arrow, try to kill the scientists as they often leave loot on their body such as med pens and ammo. You can avoid them by leaving a radius whilst running past though.

## What to do with your loot:
You can depo valuable things back in your base to avoid them being stolen, but if you have found things that you do not want then you can take them to a recycler to exchange them for valuable resources.
Recyclers can be found in various places with different efficiency rates. In safe zones the recyclers have a lower efficiency rate of 40% , but they guarantee your safety whilst using it. 
If you want to use recyclers out of the safe zones, you are at risk of being killed but they have a much better efficiency rate at 60%. These can be found at Oxums Gas Station, Harbour, Ferry terminal, Junkyard, and Mining Outpost.

## Which components are valuable?
Press "TAB" to open the crafting menu. This will show you all of the craftable items there are, and what you need to craft them. Many of the items needed for crafting are found in crates and barrels, so make sure you don't recycle everything.

## Fuel
Along the roads you will find red barrels containing crude oil, and low grade fuel. These barrels don't spawn in as frequently as the other barrels, and it can take quite a while to be able to gather enough to craft.
If you are near it, you can visit Dome which has several fuel barrels underneath, and an oil refinary where you can burn the crude oil which changes into low grade fuel. This is one of the easiest ways to get enough fuel to build a few furnaces to smelt ore.
