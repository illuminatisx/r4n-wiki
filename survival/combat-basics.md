## Overview

Combat in Rust is unforgiving and victory often depends on skill, gear, and positioning rather than just who shoots first. This guide will help new players understand the basics of combat and improve their chances of survival during encounters.

## Weapon Progression

Rust features a wide range of weapons, from primitive to military-grade:

### Melee Weapons
- **Rock**: Starting tool, poor weapon but better than nothing
- **Bone Knife**: Fast, cheap weapon with okay damage
- **Salvaged Cleaver**: Strong melee option for early game

### Primitive Ranged
- **Hunting Bow**: First ranged weapon, effective at medium range
- **Crossbow**: Improved damage and accuracy over bow but slow to reload
- **Compound Bow**: Powerful when fully drawn, requires standing still and a bit of skill

### Firearms
- **Eoka Pistol**: Unreliable single-shot handgun
- **Waterpipe Shotgun**: Powerful at close range
- **Double Barrel Shotgun**: Two quick shots, devastating up close
- **Revolver**: Six shots, decent medium-range option
- **Semi-Auto Pistol**: Fast firing handgun, good all-rounder
- **Python Revolver**: High damage, accurate revolver
- **Semi-Auto Rifle (SAR)**: Reliable mid-tier rifle
- **Thompson/Custom SMG**: Fast-firing close-range weapons
- **Assault Rifle**: Highest tier, difficult to control

**New Player Tip**: Master primitive weapons before relying on firearms. Bows are silent and cost-effective.

## Understanding Damage and Protection

Damage in Rust is affected by multiple factors:

- **Hit Location**: Headshots deal significantly more damage
- **Distance**: Damage falls off at range for most weapons
- **Armor**: Reduces damage based on protection percentage
- **Projectile Type**: Different ammo types have various properties
- **Bleeding**: Some weapons cause bleeding damage over time

### Armor Types
- **Cloth**: Minimal protection, better than nothing
- **Leather**: Light protection with minimal movement penalty
- **Roadsign**: Mid-tier protection, good balance
- **Metal**: Strong protection with movement penalty
- **Heavy Plate**: Maximum protection but severe movement reduction

## Combat Tactics for Beginners

### Defensive Combat
1. **Avoid Fair Fights**: Only engage when you have an advantage
2. **Use Cover**: Always keep objects between you and enemies
3. **Retreat Option**: Plan your escape route before engaging
4. **Health Items**: Keep bandages and medical syringes accessible
5. **Doorcamp Defense**: Be cautious when exiting your base

### Offensive Basics
1. **Element of Surprise**: Attack when enemies are distracted
2. **Flanking**: Approach from unexpected angles
3. **Peek Shooting**: Expose yourself minimally while shooting
4. **Sound Discipline**: Crouch-walk to reduce noise
5. **Prefire Common Spots**: Shoot at likely hiding positions
6. **Keep your gun up**: Do not aim for the feet, go for the body or the head

## Managing Recoil and Aim

Each weapon has a unique recoil pattern and a bunch of randomness:

- **Tap Firing**: Press and release for single shots (better accuracy)
- **Burst Firing**: 2-3 quick shots then pause (balance of speed/accuracy)
- **Spray Control**: Pull down and compensate for horizontal recoil

**Practice Tip**: Join a combat practice server with targets to get a feeling for the gun of your choice.

## Understanding Projectile Physics

Rust has realistic projectile behavior:

- **Bullet Drop**: Bullets fall over distance
- **Travel Time**: Projectiles are not instant
- **Leading Targets**: Aim ahead of moving targets

## Common Combat Mistakes

- Engaging multiple enemies alone
- Fighting with insufficient healing items
- Standing still too much while shooting
- Reloading in the open
- Using the wrong weapon for the distance
- Looting bodies immediately after a kill
- Ignoring footstep sounds
- Fighting without a respawn point nearby
- Fighting without an escape route ready

## Improving Your Combat Skills

1. **Join Combat Servers**: Dedicated servers for practice
2. **Record Gameplay**: Review your deaths to learn
3. **Study Base Defense**: Learn common raid tactics
4. **Practice with Friends**: Set up 1v1 situations

Remember that combat in Rust has a steep learning curve. Even experienced players die frequently, so don't get discouraged by defeats. Focus on improvement rather than perfect survival.
