## Overview

Your base is your most important asset in Rust it protects your resources, provides a respawn point, and serves as your crafting hub. This guide will help new players understand the fundamentals of building a secure starter base.

## Base Location Essentials

Choosing the right location is critical for your survival:

- **Proximity to Resources**: Build near nodes for easy farming
- **Monument Distance**: Close enough for scrap runs, far enough to avoid heavy traffic
- **Terrain Advantages**: Use rocks, cliffs, or dense forests for natural protection
- **Avoid Main Roads**: High-traffic areas increase raid risk
- **Building Restricted Zones**: Some areas don't allow building (marked red on map)
- **Clan proximity and large bases**: Building near large bases and clans increase raid risk

**Location tip**: The snow biome often has fewer players but harsher survival conditions. Desert has more visibility but less wood.

## Building Materials and Progression

Bases progress through these material tiers:

1. **Twig**: Extremely weak, anyone can destroy/modify
2. **Wood**: Vulnerable to fire, provides minimal security
3. **Stone**: Standard base material, resistant to melee tools
4. **Sheet Metal**: Stronger than stone, weak to explosives
5. **Armored**: Strongest tier, expensive to upgrade and maintain

**Important**: Always upgrade from twig immediately twig structures can be destroyed by anyone. Don't forget the doorframes!

## Your First Starter Base

A simple 2x1 or 2x2 design is perfect for beginners:

### Building Steps:
1. Gather ~3,200 - 4,000 wood for basic structures, TC, locks and doors.
2. Gather ~3,500 - 4,000 stone for upgrades of the foundations, walls, roofs and doorframes.
3. Gather 30 cloth for a sleeping bag.
4. Create a square foundation.
5. Place a wall in the back and a wall on the right of the foundation.
6. Now try your best to place the Tool Cupboard (TC) as far in the corner between the 2 walls as possible.
7. Now authorize yourself, and don't forget to lock it afterwards with a lock!
8. Place the rest of the walls and doorways.
9. Add the ceilings.
10. Upgrade everything to at least wood, but stone would be best.
11. Add the wooden doors with the locks.
12. Place a sleeping bag inside.

### Essential Base Components:
- **Tool Cupboard (TC)**: Prevents unauthorized building nearby, place in most secure spot!
- **Sleeping Bag**: Your spawn point after death, don't be shy to place a few more around the base.
- **Doors**: Take a look at our next section to create a secure airlock and place the doors.
- **Storage**: Start with small boxes, upgrade to large when possible.

**Tip:** NEVER create a key for your keylocks, you WILL lose them and someone will be able to enter your base.

## Building a Secure Airlock

An airlock is crucial for preventing deep losses when entering/exiting:

1. Create a small entrance room with two doors, for example a triangle foundation.
2. Ensure the doors swing in opposite directions.
3. Only open one door at a time.

## Key Security Features

Even for a starter base, consider these security enhancements:

- **Honeycomb**: Extra layers of walls around your main structure, keeps the baddies out!
- **Multiple TCs**: For larger and more complex bases, consider multiple cupboards.
- **Bunker Entrances**: Advanced technique using temporary twig.
- **Roof Access**: Consider adding a shooting floor, watch tower or at least some turrets.
- **External TCs**: Small external bases with TCs to prevent people building up.

## Additional tips and tricks

1. **Start Small**: Don't build bigger than you can upgrade
2. **Hide Your TC**: Place it in the least obvious/accessible spot
3. **Multiple Doors**: Each door is another layer of security
4. **Lock Everything**: Even airlock internally and internal doors should be always be locked
5. **Spread Loot**: Don't keep all valuables in one place
6. **Metal Doors ASAP**: Upgrade wooden doors quickly
7. **Build in Stages**: Secure a small core first, then expand
8. **Backups Matter**: Create stashes or small backup bases
9. **Bags nearby**: Make sure you have a ton of sleeping bags / beds nearby your base

## Common Base Building Mistakes

- Building too big before securing core
- Using weak doors with strong walls
- Obvious TC placement
- No airlock
- Building in high-traffic areas
- Not upgrading beyond twig or wood
- Storing all loot in one room
- Forgetting to lock doors
- Forgetting to upgrade doorframes
- Creating keys for keylocks

Remember, no base is completely raid-proof. The goal is to make your base cost more to raid than what raiders will get from it.
